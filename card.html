                <p id= "Intro">Chipmunks are small, striped rodents of the family Sciuridae. Chipmunks are found in North America, with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia.</p>
                <ul id= "Intro">
                <li><strong>Kingdom</strong>: Animalia</li>
                <li><strong>Life Span</strong>: 6 - 10 years</li>
                <li><strong>Mass</strong>: 50 - 150gm</li>
                <li><strong>Length</strong>: 18 - 25cm</li>

            <p id="summary">Chipmunks generally gather food on the ground in areas with underbrush, rocks, and logs, where they can hide from predators like hawks, foxes, coyotes, weasels, and snakes. They feed on insects, nuts, berries, seeds, fruit, and grain which they stuff into their generous cheek pouches and carry to their burrow or nest to store. Chipmunks hibernate, but instead of storing fat, they periodically dip into their cache of nuts and seeds throughout the winter.</p>
